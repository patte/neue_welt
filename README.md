Neue Welt
=========

This is the repository for the neuewelt website.

## Installation
This webapp is based on [Meteor](http://meteor.com). If you haven't installed it already, this is how you get it.
```
curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh
```

## Run
```
git clone https://github.com/patte/neue_welt.git
cd neue_welt/app
meteor
```

### special packages
At the moment I wait for this [PR](https://github.com/jshimko/meteor-ghostdown/pull/12) to be merged into [meteor-ghostdown](https://github.com/jshimko/meteor-ghostdown). To make ghostdown work as expected, check out [my fork](https://github.com/patte/meteor-ghostdown).
```
cd neue_welt/app/packages
git clone https://github.com/patte/meteor-ghostdown
```
